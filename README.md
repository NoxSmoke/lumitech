# 🌟 LumiTech

**LumiTech** is a side-scrolling platformer prototype built in **Godot 4**, inspired by *Super Mario World* and developed as a personal sandbox for learning, iteration, and AI synchronization.

This game started as a quick prototype and grew into a fully functional gameplay loop — complete with animations, collectibles, music, UI, sound, pause system, and ending screen — all built in less than 8 hours.
